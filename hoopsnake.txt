The hoop snake is a legendary creature of the USA, Canada, and Oceania/Australia.
It appears in the Pecos Bill stories; although his description of hoop snakes is the one with which people are most familiar, stories of the creature predate those fictional tales considerably.
Several sightings of the hoop snake have been alleged along the Minnesota-Wisconsin border in the St. Croix River valley (Recently Hudson, Wisconsin), Wake County in North Carolina, Prince Edward Island, and Kamloops, British Columbia.
The hoop snake is described as a poisonous snake which can bite things with its tail, and then roll away like a wheel.
